# TerrariaClone

- A simple tech demo consisting of infinite, procedurally generated 2d terrain, similar to Terraria's; this terrain generation is achieved via Perlin noise
- The player can also freely manipulate the terrain and other structures, just like you can in Terraria (or minecraft more familiarly)
